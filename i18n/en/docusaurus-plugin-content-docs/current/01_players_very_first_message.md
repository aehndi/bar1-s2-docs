Hello everyone,

Season 2 (**Polar Storm**) is starting soon and works **differently from Season 1**.
Please take a moment to read this message. It helps to avoid stress, losses, and problems.

---

**1️⃣ Start and Teleport**

* We start **at a random position on the map**. This is **NOT** our final location.
* There is **only a very limited number of free teleports**.
* **Please DO NOT teleport immediately.**
* We will clearly inform you, **when** and **where** we as an alliance will move.

👉 Treat the **free teleport** as if there is **only one**.

---

**2️⃣ Furnace and Resistance have highest priority**

* The **high-temperature furnace (Furnace)** is the most important building in Season 2.
* First:

  * Upgrade furnace
  * Increase temperature and virus resistance
* No experiments, **no unnecessary speed**, no unnecessary fights.

Without sufficient resistance, no progress is possible.

---

**3️⃣ Discipline with resources**

* **Coal is very scarce.**
* Please use coal **ONLY** for:

  * Furnace
  * mandatory season buildings
* No continuous heating and **no tests without necessity**.

---

**4️⃣ Fights and conquests**

* **Day 1-2: NO conquests**
* From **day 3-4** possibly first small actions
* Larger conquests **only after announcement by alliance leadership**

Too early fights cost troops and set individuals and the alliance back.

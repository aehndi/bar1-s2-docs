Hello everyone,

Season 2 (**Polar Storm**) is starting soon and works **differently from Season 1**.
Please take a moment to read this message. This helps avoid stress, losses, and problems.

---

**1️⃣ Start and Teleport**

* We start **at a random position on the map**. This is **NOT** our final location.
* There are **only a very limited number of free teleports**.
* **Please do NOT teleport immediately.**
* We will clearly inform you **when** and **where** we move as an alliance.

👉 Treat the **free teleport** as if there is **only one**.

---

**2️⃣ Furnace and Resistance have highest priority**

* The **high-temperature furnace (Furnace)** is the most important building in Season 2.
* First:

  * Upgrade Furnace
  * Increase temperature and virus resistance
* No experiments, **no unnecessary haste**, no unnecessary fights.

Without sufficient resistance, no progress is possible.

---

**3️⃣ Discipline with resources**

* **Coal is very scarce.**
* Please use coal **ONLY** for:

  * Furnace
  * absolutely necessary Season buildings
* No permanent heating and **no tests without necessity**.

---

**4️⃣ Fights and conquests**

* **Day 1–2: NO conquests**
* From **Day 3–4** possibly first small actions
* Larger conquests **only after announcement by alliance leadership**

Too early fights cost troops and set individuals and the alliance back.

---

**⚠️ Temperature Warning (very important)**
Teleports, fights, and several actions in a row **lower the temperature**.
After a teleport **no direct fights**.
Please check the temperature before every action. Frozen bases are **no mistake**.

---

**5️⃣ Mindset for Season 2**

* Patience is more important than activism
* Stability is more important than speed
* We play Season 2 **coordinated as an alliance**, not as individual players

**Summary:**
Do not teleport, do not rush, upgrade Furnace, wait for announcements.

For questions, please **report before actions**.

Thank you 👍
Let's play it cleanly and coordinated.

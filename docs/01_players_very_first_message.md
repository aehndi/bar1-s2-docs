**🕐 Server 1692: Reset 3:00 AM CET → S2 startet ca. 3:05 AM CET**

Hello everyone,

Season 2 (**Polar Storm**) is starting soon and works **differently from Season 1**.  
Please take a moment to read this message. This helps avoid stress, losses, and problems.

---

**⚠️ WICHTIG: Doom Walker erst NACH S2-Start angreifen (höchstes Level für First Blood Coal!)**

---

**1️⃣ Start and Teleport**

* We start **at a random position on the map**. This is **NOT** our final location.  
* There are **only a very limited number of free teleports**.  
* **Please do NOT teleport immediately.**  
* We will clearly inform you **when** and **where** we move as an alliance.

👉 Treat the **free teleport** as if there is **only one**.

---

**2️⃣ Furnace and Resistance have highest priority**

* The **high-temperature furnace (Furnace)** is the most important building in Season 2.  
* First:
  * Upgrade Furnace  
  * Increase temperature and virus resistance  
* No experiments, **no unnecessary haste**, no unnecessary fights.

Without sufficient resistance, no progress is possible.

---

**3️⃣ Discipline with resources**

* **Coal is very scarce.**  
* Please use coal **ONLY** for:
  * Furnace  
  * absolutely necessary Season buildings  
* No permanent heating and **no tests without necessity**.

---

**4️⃣ Boss-Fights and captures**

* **Day 1–2: NO conquests**  
* From **Day 3–4** possibly first small actions  
* Dig site and city captures **only after announcement by alliance leadership**

Too early fights cost troops and set individuals and the alliance back.

---

**⚠️ Temperature Warning (very important)**  
Teleports, fights, and several actions in a row **lower the temperature**.  
After a teleport **no direct fights**.  
Please check the temperature before every action. Frozen bases are **no mistake**.

---

**5️⃣ Mindset for Season 2**

* Patience is more important than activism  
* Stability is more important than speed  
* We play Season 2 **coordinated as an alliance**, not as individual players  

---

**Short checklist (very important):**

- Server 1692: **S2 startet 3:05 AM CET** – Doom Walker erst DANACH (höchstes Level)!  
- Do **not** teleport until alliance leadership gives the target location.  
- Build and upgrade the **Furnace first** – temperature and resistance before everything else.  
- Use **coal only** for Furnace and real emergencies – no permanent heating.  
- **Day 1–2 no captures**, only safe PvE targets.  
- Check your **temperature before every action**; after teleport, wait before fighting.

For questions, please **report before actions**.

Thank you 👍  
Let's play it cleanly and coordinated.
